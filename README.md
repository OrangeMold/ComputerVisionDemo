## Inspiration
Having experiences in the workfield, one of our teammates was petrified by the alarming amount of overlooked security protocols that occur on a daily basis. The place was **crawling** with hand pallet trucks and forklifts, but they never suggested to his 16 year old self to wear steel-toe shoes. It is our duty as citizens of the world to ensure proper safety amongst all workers. 
## What it does
SafeShift is an advanced AI-powered system designed to detect workplace safety hazards in real-time. Our solution is fully customizable, allowing businesses to define specific safety requirements based on their industry needs. For smaller-scale companies, we offer a pre-configured version with built-in safety detections for essential protective gear, available at a more accessible rate. Whether it’s ensuring compliance with PPE regulations or identifying hazardous workplace behaviors, SafeShift provides a proactive approach to safety monitoring.
## How we built it
We made an in-house machine learning algorithm and trained it on an extensive, open-source computer vision dataset. Our AI continuously improves through deep learning, ensuring accurate detection and adaptation to diverse workplace environments.  It has over 3.6 million parameters.
## Challenges we ran into
We were severely limited by time. Built under tight deadlines, we didn't have the resources to fully train our prototype model to its full capacity. Also, if given more time, we could train the same AI model to detect litter. This would add value by making our company more green and sustainable.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite the constraints, our current model successfully detects essential PPE such as hard hats. This is just the beginning—our vision for workplace safety is clearer than ever, and we’re proud to have taken the first step toward revolutionizing safety monitoring through AI.
## What we learned
Beyond technical development, we gained valuable insight into the entrepreneurial side of software engineering. Understanding profit margins, B2B partnerships, and real-world business strategies reshaped how we approach software development—not just as engineers but as innovators building a scalable and impactful solution.
## What's next for SafeShift
Our goal is to integrate an expansive range of safety procedures into SafeShift. From construction sites to warehouses, factories, and beyond, we envision a future where workplace accidents become a thing of the past—because no one should have to compromise on safety.
